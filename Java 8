Increased code conciseness, a higher level of abstraction with Java 8. (instead of writing verbose code)


Functional Style Programming 
--------------------------------------------------------
(DRY (don’t repeat yourself) principle of software engineering.)

Behaviour Parameterization: Technique for passing code to methods as parameter. 
The method’s behavior is parameterized. You are able to pass multiple behaviors to your method.

better way than adding lots of parameters to cope with changing requirements. 

 

predicate (that is, a function that returns a boolean). 



side-effect-free functions or stateless functions: writing code that doesn’t access shared mutable data to do its job. no shared mutable data.

In contrast, in the imperative programming paradigm you typically describe a program in terms of a sequence of statements that mutate state.

The no-shared-mutable-data requirement means that a method is perfectly described solely by the way it transforms arguments to results; in other words, it behaves as a mathematical function and has no (visible) side effects.
